										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adah Sharma’s film The Kerala Story is seeing a drop in its box office collection now. However, it still has the potential to cross the Rs 250-crore mark.</p>
<p>By Grace Cyril: Sudipto Sen’s directorial venture The Kerla Story recently crossed the Rs 200-crore mark at the box office. It has now slowed down in its collection. On Day 25, May 29, the film minted its lowest yet, that is, Rs 2.10 crore. Nevertheless, TKS has created quite a roar at the box office and is expected to cross the Rs 250-crore mark soon. The film delves into the serious subject of religious conversions, the ISIS, and chronicles around three women.</p>
<p>THE KERALA STORY BOX OFFICE COLLECTION<br />
Amid all the controversies surrounding The Kerala Story, the film released on May 5. Ever since, it has been doing incredibly well at the box office. On Day 18, the film even managed to cross the Rs 200-crore club. After crossing that milestone, TKS slowed down in its collection. As per the early trade estimates, on Day 25, the film minted Rs 2.10 crore at the box office. Hence, the total collection of The Kerala Story now stands at Rs 227.07 crore. It had an overall 10.30 per cent occupancy in Hindi on May 28.</p>
<p>ABOUT THE KERALA STORY<br />
The Kerala Story follows the story of a Hindu woman from Kerala, played by Adah Sharma. She is brainwashed to embrace Islam and sent to Syria, where she is forced to join the ISIS terrorist organisation. She is tortured there. The film is directed by Sudipto Sen and produced by Vipul Amrutlal Shah. The Kerala Story has been in the scanner ever since the trailer was released.</p>
